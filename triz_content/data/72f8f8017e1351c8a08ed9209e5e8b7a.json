      "Typical parametersis a limited set of the pre-defined generalized parameters that typically need improvement in theengineering system, used in thecontradiction (Altshuller) matrix.",
      "To work with the contradiction matrix, the improving and worsening parameters in an engineering contradiction must be expressed in the form of typical parameters included in the matrix. Due to the diversity of engineering fields, reducing the specific parameters to typical ones is a fundamental aspect of the universality of the Altshuller matrix",
      "Sometimes, a specific parameter may already align with a standard parameter. However, if it does not, conversion is necessary. This applies to both the vertical and horizontal axes of the matrix.",
      "Below, we have provided a complete list of 39 standard parameters, along with examples of specific parameters most commonly associated with them. Keep in mind that the list of specific parameters is not definitive, and each problem should be approached individually.",
      "Keep in mind that our examples are merely suggestions. If you believe your specific parameters can be better expressed using other typical parameters, feel free to do so. This may only increase the number of solution concepts generated.",
      "A good practice is to create several combinations of different standard parameters that fit the formulated contradiction and use the contradiction matrix for each pair. This results in multiple sets of recommendations, each of which should be considered as a potentially best guideline.",
      "Note that in several cases, the typical parameters distinguish between a moving object and a stationary object. Amoving objectis one that stays in motion or changes position relative to another object involved in the problem. This movement can vary – it might be caused by external forces or happen on its own, and it can be linear, rotational, very small, or cover a large distance. Common examples include items designed to be portable. In contrast, thestationary objectremains completely still relative to the other object in the problem, with no movement between them.",
